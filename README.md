# MMOpenRPG
An open framework for handling common MMO/RPG video game logic. (This is not an engine and does not include a renderer!)

The actual logic of the framework lives in MMOpenRPG.Framework, while MMOpenRPG.ExampleConsumer only exists to test and demonstrate calls to the Framework. Modifying the ExampleConsumer is never required.
